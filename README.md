# Event Management Application

Web application for managing events in any organization. Each event has list of sessions and partners. The administrator can create, update and delete events by following a three step process,
- Step 1 : Add Basic Event Details (event name, dates, venue, event banner, etc)
- Step 2 : Add Sessions (session name, dates, venue, session banner, speakers (name, title, profile photo, etc) for each session, etc)
- Step 3 : Add Partners (partner name, description, partner logo, etc)

Administrator can create an event after completing the above three steps. There is also an option to save and continue later at each step if the administrator needs to create a huge event with lot of sessions and partners. Once the event is created, admin can update any level of information inside the event and publish it.
